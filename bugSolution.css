To resolve this, ensure that the extra space taken up by the `box-shadow` is considered in the layout. One approach is to use the `box-sizing` property.  By setting `box-sizing: border-box;`, the padding and border are included within the element's specified width and height.  This makes the `box-shadow` less likely to cause unexpected layout problems:

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Alternatively, you can explicitly account for the `box-shadow` offset in your layout calculations.
